- PHP version (^8.2)
- Laravel Version (^12.0.0)

1. Install the composer packages

   ```bash
    composer install
   ```

2. In the root directory, you will find a file named `.env.example`, rename the given file name to `.env` and run the following command to generate the key (You can also setup your database credentials here).

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

3. By running the following command, you will be able to get all the dependencies in your node_modules folder:

   ```bash
   yarn

   # npm install [for npm]
   ```

4. To run the project, you need to run following command in the project directory. It will compile the php files & all the other project files. If you are making any changes in any of the php file then you need to run the given command again.

   ```bash
   yarn build

   # npm run build [for npm]
   ```

5. To serve the application you need to run the following command in the project directory. (This will give you an address with port number 8000.)

   Now navigate to the given address you will see your application is running.

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

6. To change the port address, run the following command:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve --port=8080 // For port 8080
   sudo php artisan serve --port=80 // If you want to run it on port 80, you probably need to sudo.
   ```

7. `Watching for changes:` If you want to watch all the changes you make in the application then run the following command in the root directory.

   ```bash
   yarn dev

   # npm run watch [for npm]
   ```

8. `Building for Production:` If you want to run the project and make the build in the production mode then run the following command in the root directory, otherwise the project will continue to run in the development mode.

   **Make sure to change the `APP_ENV=local` variable's value `APP_ENV=production`.**

   ```bash
   yarn prod

   # npm run production [for npm]
   ```

   ### Required Permissions on server

   If you are facing any issues regarding the permissions, then you need to run the following command in your project directory:

## Documentation üìú

Check out our live [Documentation](https://demos.pixinvent.com/vuexy-html-admin-template/documentation/laravel-introduction.html)

## Support üë®‚Äçüíª

We use Product purchase code as support tickets to manage Item support.

Make sure you use our [Support Portal](https://pixinvent.ticksy.com/) to create a support ticket.

## Why forking is disabled? üîí

You will lose repository access when your support expires. If you have forked the repo and you lose the access to our repo then your fork also got deleted by GitHub.

Hence, as precautions we disabled forking our repo.

**Solution**

However, you can still keep your repo even after your support expires by setting our repo as upstream:

1. Create a new **private repo** in your GitHub. Make sure it's a private repo. You can't share our code publicly as per license.
2. Clone our repo: `git clone https://github.com/pixinvent/vuexy-html-laravel-admin-template.git`
3. Navigate to cloned directory
4. Remove our repo as origin by running command: `git remote remove origin`
5. Add your newly created repo as origin by running command: `git remote add origin YOUR_NEWLY_CREATE_REPO_GIT_URL`
6. Add our repo as upstream by running command: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/pixinvent/vuexy-html-laravel-admin-template.git`
7. Push the code to GitHub by running command: `git push -u origin main`

Now, whenever you want to pull the latest changes from our repo just pull the changes by running command: `git pull upstream main`

Cheers ü•Ç
